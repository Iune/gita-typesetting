# Telugu Typesetting for the Bhagavad Gita

This repository contains resources to produce a LaTeX-typeset PDF for the Bhagavad Gita. Here, the written form matches the pronounciation for chanting the Bhagavad Gita (see the [SGS Gita Foundation](https://www.sgsgitafoundation.org/assets/resources/SrimadBhagawadGeeta_English.pdf) PDF as reference).
